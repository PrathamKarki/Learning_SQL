# Learning_SQL

Hello everyone! 👋

I'm currently learning **SQL** to strengthen my data management and querying skills. My goal is to understand how to interact with databases effectively, write complex queries, and work with real-world datasets.

## 🚀 Learning Journey

### ✅ Platforms I'm  Currently Using:
- **Codecademy** – for foundational concepts and guided interactive learning.
- **SQLBolt** – for quick, practical lessons with visual examples.


## 🧪 Practice and Application

I'm regularly practicing SQL through challenges and exercises that cover:

### 🛠️ Data Manipulation & Table Operations
- Creating tables using `CREATE TABLE`
- Inserting records using `INSERT INTO`
- Updating data with `UPDATE`
- Deleting records using `DELETE FROM`
- Modifying table structure using `ALTER TABLE`

### 🔍 Querying Data
- Retrieving data with `SELECT`
- Using `DISTINCT` to remove duplicates
- Filtering with `WHERE`, `BETWEEN`, `OR`, `AND`, `IS NULL`
- Aliasing columns with `AS`

### 📊 Aggregate Functions & Grouping
- Aggregating data using `COUNT`, `SUM`, `ROUND`
- Grouping results with `GROUP BY`
- Filtering grouped results with `HAVING`

- other topics such as 'joins', 'subqueries', CTEs' and 'window functions' to be covered soon.

## 📈 Goals

- Build strong SQL fundamentals
